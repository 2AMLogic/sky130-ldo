| Category | Severity | Side | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| device.body_unverified | warning | layout | 4 NMOS device body terminal(s) were compared against the 'vsubs' deck-synthesized substrate net, not a real schematic net -- no drawn substrate-tap geometry resolved these device(s)' body terminal to a real net (see docs/cli/extract.md, "Coverage") |
| topology | warning | both | nets were paired ambiguously; the comparer resolved it structurally (consider a hints.same_nets entry to pin this down) |
